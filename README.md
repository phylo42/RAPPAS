RAPPAS is a program dedicated to "Phylogenetic Placement" (PP) of metagenomic or metabarcoding reads on a reference tree. As apposed to previous PP programs, RAPPAS is based on the phylo-kmers idea, detailed in tis manuscript and uses a 2 step approach divided into a) the database build, and b) the placement itself.

This README contains short instructions to build and launch RAPPAS. 

You will find __more detailed instructions, test datasets, pre-built databases and tutorials__ and discussions related to phylogenetic placement on the [wiki page](https://github.com/blinard-BIOINFO/RAPPAS/wiki).


## Important notices

```diff

01/2020

RAxML-ng support added in RAPPAS v1.20.
phyml (>=3.3.20190909), paml (>=4.9) or raxml-ng (>=0.9.0) ancestral reconstructions (AR)
are now compatible with RAPPAS. As they produce similar results, AR software selection
depends mostly on the time/RAM balance you can handle.
(see "Note on PhyML, PAML and RAxML binaries" below).
In your productions, please think to cite both RAPPAS and the selected AR software.

09/2019

Due to an output format change in PhyML, RAPPAS may fail with PhyML version <3.3.20190909.
We STRONGLY recommand to use PhyML >=3.3.20190909 and RAPPAS >=1.12 !
You can download this version of PhyML from its GIT repository.

**If you install RAPPAS with conda, the correct version will be automatically selected.**

06/2019

When placing on large trees, remember that the default limits of PhyML are quite low.
(<4000 taxa, sequence labels <1000 characters)
You can work with larger trees and longer sequence labels after the following changes:

1) Modify the following lines in the src/utilities.h source file of PhyML :
#define  T_MAX_FILE          2000
#define  T_MAX_NAME          5000
#define  N_MAX_OTU         262144
2) Recompile phyml after these changes.
3) Launch RAPPAS.

``` 


## Description

RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic PLacement via Ancestral Sequences) is a program dedicated to "Phylogenetic Placement" (PP) of metagenomic reads on a reference tree. As apposed to previous PP programs, RAPPAS is based on the phylo-kmers idea, detailed in tis manuscript and uses a 2 step approach divided into a) the database build, and b) the placement itself.

The main advantage of RAPPAS is that it is alignment free, which means that after step (a) (the DB build) is performed, metagenomic reads can be directly placed on a referene tree _WITHOUT_ aligning them to the reference alignment on which the tree was built (as required by other approaches).

The second advantage of RAPPAS is its algorithm based on phylo-kmers matches, making its execution time linear with respect to the length of the placed sequences.

RAPPAS was funded from  the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 634650. (Virogenesis.eu)

## Installation

### Bioconda installation

If you use bioconda, you can install RAPPAS with the following commands:
```
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install rappas
```
Then you can run RAPPAS with the command:

```
rappas [options]
```

If you need to customize Java JVM parameters (for instance when requesting more memory with options -Xmx/-Xms), use the following bash command:

```
java -Xmx16G -jar $(which RAPPAS.jar) [options]
```

### From sources: prerequisites

- RAPPAS compilation requires a clean javac compiler installation. Java >=1.8 is compulsory as some operations are based on Lambda expressions.
- Apache Ant is used to facilitate the compilation.

We provide instructions for Debian-based Linux distributions. For compiling Java sources with Apache Ant on other operating systems, please perform analogous operations on your system.

Using OpenJDK 1.8 (more recent versions also compatible):
```
#install packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
#update relevant symlinks to make v1.8 default
sudo update-java-alternatives --set java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64

```
Using the proprietary Oracle JDK 1.8  (more recent versions also compatible):
```
#install packages
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
#update relevant symlinks to make v1.8 default
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default
```

Installation of Apache Ant:
```
sudo apt-get install ant
```

### From sources: download and compilation

```
#download git repository
git clone -b master https://github.com/blinard-BIOINFO/RAPPAS.git
#compile
cd RAPPAS && ant -f build-cli.xml
```
The executable RAPPAS.jar can then be found in the ./dist directory.

You can create also create a standalone executable using a stub. If you use this approach, be aware you will need to setup the java virtual machine options manually by modify the stub.sh file and that they cannot be modified later.
```
cd ..
cat stub.sh dist/RAPPAS.jar > rappas && chmod +x rappas
```
When using the standalone binary and not the jar file, in all instructions and tutorials just remember to replace 'java [jvm_options] -jar RAPPAS.jar' by 'rappas' in the instructions and tutorials detailed below. 



## Usage

### Reference Dataset
First, one has to prepare a reference dataset designed to answer a biological question. Typically, in the context of metagenomics and taxonomic identifications, a marker gene (16S rRNA, cox1, rbcl...) is used to build a reference species tree. This species tree is the basis for phylogenetic placement of marker gene(s).
For RAPPAS, the reference dataset is composed of:
1. A reference alignment of all sequences of this marker gene
2. A phylogenetic tree inferred from this reference alignment

Such reference marker gene datasets can be found, for instance from:
- "The All-Species Living Tree" Project (LTP, eukaryote rRNAs) :  <https://www.arb-silva.de/projects/living-tree/>,
- Greengenes (bacterial 16S) : <http://greengenes.secondgenome.com/>,
- Any marker database from EukRef: <http://eukref.org/databases/>,
- The curated database of Eukref : <http://eukref.org/databases/>,
- Or built internally in the lab.

### Sharing pre-built RAPPAS databases

While our goal is to allow stable databases that can be broadly shared, RAPPAS is still in active development. Some major changes may induce that a recent version (ex: v1.05) becomes incompatible with a DB built using an older version (ex: v1.01). Such incompatibilities are clearly stated in the "release" page and the changelog. Also be aware that, because uses internal Java serialization, you may run to troubles when sharing databases between users using different Java versions or Oracle JDK VS OpenJDK.

### RAPPAS database build 

__Basic command__

```
java -Xmx8G -jar RAPPAS.jar -p b -s [nucl|prot] -b ARbinary -w workdir -r reference_alignment.fasta -t reference_tree.newick
```

where

option | expected value | description
--- | --- | ---
**-p <br/>(--phase)** | "b" | Invokes the "database build" process.
**-s <br/>(--states)** | "nucl" or "prot" | Set if we use a nucleotide or protein analysis.
**-b <br/>(--arbinary)** | binary of PhyML (>=3.3.20190909),PAML (>=4.9) or RAxML-ng (>=0.9.0) | Set the path to the binary used for ancestral sequence reconstruction (see note below).
**-w <br/>(--workdir)** | directory | Set the directory to save the database in.
**-r <br/>(--refalign)** | file | The reference alignment, in fasta format.
**-t <br/>(--reftree)̀** | file | The reference tree, in newick format.

__Note on PhyML, PAML and RAxML binaries__:
Currently, the following programs are fully supported by RAPPAS for generating ancestral sequence posterior probabilities:
- RAxML-ng :  Fastest & recommended but may require lots of RAM (you have to use phyml-v3.3.20180214).
- PhyML    :  ~10x slower, requires slightly less memory.
- PAML     :  ~100x slower, but very low memory footprint.

__Note on -Xm[x]G option__:
The process of database build can be memory intensive for values of k>=10.
To make RAPPAS run smoothly, allocate more memory (more heap) to the java process using the option -Xm[x]G where [x] is replaced by an integer value.
For instance, -Xm8G will extend the java heap to a maximum of 8Gb of memory, -Xmx16G will extend it to a maximum of 16Gb ... 

You can use the latest versions provided on the authors' websites. PhyML requires at least version 3.3 (see [PhyML GIT](https://github.com/stephaneguindon/phyml) ), but we recommand the _HACKED VERSIONS_ available in this git repository in the /depbin directory.

These are based on slightly modified sources of PhyML and PAML: no change in ML computations, but useless outputs are skipped, making the ancestral reconstruction process faster (in particular for PAML).

The reconstruction will result in the production of a directory structure and a database file in the given "workdir":

file or directory | description
--- | --- 
**[DBname].union** | The RAPPAS database itself.
**[workdir]/extended_tree** | Temporary files used at DB construction, allowing the exploration of ghost nodes.
**[workdir]/AR** | Temporary files used at DB construction, the raw output of PhyML or PAML.
**[workdir]/logs** | As the name says.


### Query placement

After building the RAPPAS DB, placement commands can be called numerous times on different query sequence datasets.
v1.00 of RAPPAS places 1,000,000 metagenomic of 150bp in ~30-40 minutes, using only a single core of a normal desktop PC.

```
java -Xmx8G -jar RAPPAS.jar -p p -d database.union -q queries.fasta 
```

where

option | expected value | description
--- | --- | ---
**-p <br/>(--phase)** | "p" | Invokes the "placement" process.
**-d <br/>(--database)** | file | the *.union file created at previous DB build step.
**-q <br/>(--queries)** | file | The query reads, in fasta format.

__Note on -Xm[x]G option__:
Reuse the value used in the database build phase, as loading the database will basically require the same amount of memory.

The *.jplace describing the placements of all queries will be written in the ./workdir/logs directory.
